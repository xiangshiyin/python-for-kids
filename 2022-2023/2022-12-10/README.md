# Lecture 14: Function (Part II)

Today, we'll go through more examples on `functions` in Python

## Course materials
* [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nJR6TQsmUVSGYcjEullKdMU0WtroxlJn1b6jUMYMQac/edit#slide=id.p)

## Topics to explore
* **Reading**
  * Greatest common divisor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor
  * Euclidean algorithm to find GCD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGesPF3QA1U (an interesting explaination)
  * `Recursion` in Python: https://realpython.com/python-recursion/
  
* **Exercise**
  * Q1. Write a function `Fibonacci(N)` to return the Nth Fibonacci number
    * Example: 
      * Input: N = 0, Output: 0
      * Input: N = 1, Output: 1
      * Input: N = 2, Output: 1
      * Input: N = 3, Output: 2

  * Q2. Can you solve the same problem above with `recursion`?
    * Can you try a big value of `N` (such as 100, 1000, *etc.*) and see if it works with the `recursion`? If not, can you do some research online and figure out why?
