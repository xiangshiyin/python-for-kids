We will continue the topic of file input/output with Python.  Please refer to the [lecture note from last week](../2023-03-18/README.md) for core concepts.

# Topics to Explore

## Reading
* Introduction to time complexity [[reference](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/time-complexity-of-algorithms/)]
* Binary search [[reference](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search)]

## Coding
* Write a program to create a text file `line_numbers.txt` which has 100 lines of content. Each line should have a leading number indicating the corresponding line number, such as
  ```
  1: 
  2: 
  3:

  ...
