In this class, we will talk about some examples on `for` loop

## Course materials

## Topics to explore
* Play with the drawing program in section 3 of [the notebook](./practice.ipynb) we demoed in our class, try to understand how the drawing works
  * Run the notebook from local in `Jupyter Notebook`
  * Modify the code and see if you can draw a different shape!
* Give it a try to the `Extra exercises` (`4.1` and `4.2`) listed in [the notebook](./practice.ipynb), see if you figure out a solution with the `for` loop we learnt.
* Extra topics to explore
  * `help()` function in Python [[link](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/help-method#:~:text=The%20Python%20help()%20function,is%20printed%20on%20the%20console.)]
  * `Sequence` data types in Python [[link](https://python-course.eu/python-tutorial/sequential-data-types.php)]
    * Question: can we print all elements of the `sequence` with the help of `for` loop? (hint: remember what we did in our class?)
