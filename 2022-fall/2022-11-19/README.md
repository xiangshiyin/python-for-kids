## Topics to explore
* **Reading**
  * Iterate through `dictionary` [[link](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/)]
  * Iterate through `list` [[link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-a-list-in-python/)]
  
* **Exercise**
  * Q1. Write a program to print elements of a list in reversed order
    ```
    [input]: x = [1,2,3,4,5]
    [output]:
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    ```
  * Q2. Write a program to print all key-value pairs in a dictionary
    ```
    [input]: students = {'james': 12, 'kevin': 10, 'collin': 11}
    [output]:
    james, 12
    kevin, 10
