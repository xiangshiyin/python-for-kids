## Concepts
### Variable
* In computer programming, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a storage location in memory. 
* It's used to store and manage data that can change during the execution of a program. 
* Variables allow programmers to work with data, perform calculations, and create dynamic and interactive programs.
