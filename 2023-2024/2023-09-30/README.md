# Lecture 07: Conditional Statements (part II)

## Lecture topics
* [ ] Different conditional structures
  * [ ] Practice
    * Even vs. odd number
    * Check if the input number is divisible by number 2
    * Check if the input number is divisible by number 4
    * Check if the input number is divisible by either 2 and 4
    * Check if the input number is divisible by either 2 or 4
    * Celcius to Farenheit conversion and temperature reminder
    * Draw different shapes based on input requests
* [ ] `Indentation` in Python
  * The Python language design is distinguished by its emphasis on readability, simplicity, and explicitness. Some people go so far as to liken it to "executable pseudocode"
  * Python uses whitespace (tabs or spaces) to structure code instead of using braces as in many other languages like R, C++, Java, and Perl. Consider a for loop from a sorting algorithm, such as:
      ```python
      if x >= 5:
          print(f"x is greater or equal to 5")
      else:
          print(f"x is smaller than 5")
      ```
  * In C++, the same code could be like
      ```cpp
      if (x >= 5) {
          std::cout << "x is greater or equal to 5" << std::endl;
      } else {
          std::cout << "x is smaller than 5" << std::endl;
      }      
      ```
  * A colon denotes the start of an indented code block after which all of the code must be indented by the **same amount** until the end of the block
  * `Indentation` here means - **X consecutive spaces**
    * There is no restrictions on the amount of spaces to use as long as you always stick to the same amount. However, **4 consecutive spaces** is the general standard people follow
    * Many text editors have a setting that will replace tab stops with spaces automatically
  * Semicolons can be used, however, to separate multiple statements on a single line:
      ```python
      a = 5; b = 6; c = 7
      ```
    * Putting multiple statements on one line is generally discouraged in Python as it can make code less readable.
