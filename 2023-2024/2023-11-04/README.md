# Lecture 11: Non-Primitive Data Types - List

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Python programming with `vscode`
* [ ] More about `list`
* [ ] Solve the `Pascal Triangle` problem with `list`
* [ ] `for` loop and `list`
* [ ] The hangman ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34093736/71744579-0266f600-2e68-11ea-9f6c-52770981e573.gif)

## Concepts
* Run `Python Interpreter` within `vscode`
* Create an empty `list`
  ```python
  x = []
  y = list()
  ```
* `list` is ordered and mutable
* Just like `str` type
  * Length of a list - `len()`
  * Indexing and slicing
    * Reference a single element - `x[i]` ($i \le n$)
    * Reference a range - `x[start:end]` (`end` is exclusive)
      * Following patterns are also allowed
        * `x[start:]` - all elements staring from position `start`
        * `x[:end]` - all elements before position `end`
  * Combining multiple lists with `+`
  * Check exisence of an element with `in`
* Different ways to iterate through a list
