## Concepts
* A `dictionary` is a data set of key-value pairs. It provides a way to map pieces of data to each other and allows for quick access to values associated with keys
* A `dictionary` is typically in the form `dictionary_name = { key1: value1,  key2: value2,  key3: value3 }`
* Define an empty `dictionary`
  * `x = dict()` or `x = {}`
* Check if a key exists with the `in` operator
* Access a value by a key: `x[key]`
