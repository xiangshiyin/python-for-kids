# Lecture 19: Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game (part III)

## Topics
In this class, we'll continue our journey building the tic-tac-toe game. The goal is to build a graphic user interface (GUI) for the game.

Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [x] Build a graphic interface to collect user input
* [x] Consume the user input in backend code logic
* [x] Build a 3x3 grid to mimic the tic-tac-toe game board


## Recap
Here is a highlight of the class activities
* Tic-tac-toe logic enhancement to capture scenarios on quit/reset the game
  * [tic_tac_toe_v1.py](./tic_tac_toe_v1.py)
* Play with `tkinter` on creating a GUI and add widgets
  * [try_tkinker.py](./try_tkinker.py)
  * [layout_change.py](./layout_change.py)
  * [layout_change_v2.py](./layout_change_v2.py)
* Build a logic to react to button click events
  * [onclick.py](./onclick.py)
  * [onclick2.py](./onclick2.py) - didn't quite finish


## Course materials
* slides [TBD]

# Exercise / Exploration
We've done some practice to implement a graphic interface with `tkinter` and we are able to build a graphic tic-tac-toe board. However, there are still some features missing, such as 
* Button displays different text information unpon user click

Can you do some research to figure out a way to make this happen?
* Hint: maybe try the global variable idea we discussed near the end of the class?
