# Lecture 23: File Input and Output (part I)

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Use a Python library, more examples
* [ ] Install a Python library
* [ ] Read from a file
* [ ] Write to a file


## Concepts
### Import a Python library
* Same as importing an prebuilt python script, you could follow the patterns below to import a python library
  * `import <library_name>`
  * `from <library_name> import <module_name>`
  * `import <library_name>.<module_name>`
* You could also pick a different name for the library or module you are importing
  * `import <library_name> as <alias>`
  * `from <library_name> import <module_name> as <alias>`
  * `import <library_name>.<module_name> as <alias>`

### Install a Python library
* Use `pip` to install a python - a package manager for Python
  * `pip` is a command line tool that allows you to install software packages written in Python
  * When installing with `pip`, by default you are pulling the library from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/)
  * You could install a python library using `pip` command
    * `pip install <library_name>`
  * You could also install a specific version of a library
    * `pip install <library_name>==<version_number>`
* You could also use other tools to manage your python libraries, but more research needed here :grin:
  * `conda` - a package manager, an environment manager, and a channel manager [[link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)]
  * `poetry` - a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python [[link](https://python-poetry.org/)]
  * `pipenv` - a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world [[link](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)]
